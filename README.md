## Info
This is a branch of Citra including the ["Ignore format reinterpretation hack"](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/pull/4089) PR that will likely not be merged in the master branch again. It is a hack that alleviates the significant slowdowns that occur for monster roars, flashbomb effects and others in the **Monster Hunter** games when they are rendered at higher-than-native resolution.
